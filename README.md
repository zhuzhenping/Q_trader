# Q_trader
A reinforcement learning based auto-trader in stock market

This is a project base on online course Machine Learning for Trader. The testcase and the framework are provided by the instructor. All other codes are written by Y. Jiao (yjiao03@syr.edu).

The codes utilize naive Q-learning algorithm. No machine learning package is used, and all methods were written by the author. Four technical indicators are calculated (in Figure). The learner is trained by one-year those indicators, and can be tested by other data. The best strategy yields better average return than benchmark trading strategy.
